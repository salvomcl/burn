# Metric

When working with the learner, you have the option to record metrics that will be monitored
throughout the training process. We currently offer a restricted range of metrics.

| Metric            | Description                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy          | Calculate the accuracy in percentage                    |
| TopKAccuracy      | Calculate the top-k accuracy in percentage              |
| Precision         | Calculate precision in percentage                       |
| Recall            | Calculate recall in percentage                          |
| FBetaScore        | Calculate F<sub>Î² </sub>score in percentage             |
| AUROC             | Calculate the area under curve of ROC in percentage     |
| Average Precision | Calculate the area under curve of ROC in percentage     |
| Loss              | Output the loss used for the backward pass              |
| CPU Temperature   | Fetch the temperature of CPUs                           |
| CPU Usage         | Fetch the CPU utilization                               |
| CPU Memory Usage  | Fetch the CPU RAM usage                                 |
| GPU Temperature   | Fetch the GPU temperature                               |
| Learning Rate     | Fetch the current learning rate for each optimizer step |
| CUDA              | Fetch general CUDA metrics such as utilization          |

In order to use a metric, the output of your training step has to implement the `Adaptor` trait from
`burn-train::metric`. Here is an example for the classification output, already provided with the
crate.

```rust , ignore
/// Simple classification output adapted for multiple metrics.
#[derive(new)]
pub struct ClassificationOutput<B: Backend> {
    /// The loss.
    pub loss: Tensor<B, 1>,

    /// The output.
    pub output: Tensor<B, 2>,

    /// The targets.
    pub targets: Tensor<B, 1, Int>,
}

impl<B: Backend> Adaptor<AccuracyInput<B>> for ClassificationOutput<B> {
    fn adapt(&self) -> AccuracyInput<B> {
        AccuracyInput::new(self.output.clone(), self.targets.clone())
    }
}

impl<B: Backend> Adaptor<LossInput<B>> for ClassificationOutput<B> {
    fn adapt(&self) -> LossInput<B> {
        LossInput::new(self.loss.clone())
    }
}
```

# Custom Metric

Generating your own custom metrics is done by implementing the `Metric` trait.

```rust , ignore
/// Metric trait.
///
/// Implementations should define their own input type only used by the metric.
/// This is important since some conflict may happen when the model output is adapted for each
/// metric's input type.
///
/// The only exception is for metrics that don't need any input, setting the associated type
/// to the null type `()`.
pub trait Metric: Send + Sync {
    /// The input type of the metric.
    type Input;

    /// Updates the metric state and returns the current metric entry.
    fn update(&mut self, item: &Self::Input, metadata: &MetricMetadata) -> MetricEntry;
    /// Clear the metric state.
    fn clear(&mut self);
}
```

As an example, let's see how the loss metric is implemented.

```rust, ignore
/// The loss metric.
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct LossMetric<B: Backend> {
    state: NumericMetricState,
    _b: B,
}

/// The loss metric input type.
#[derive(new)]
pub struct LossInput<B: Backend> {
    tensor: Tensor<B, 1>,
}

impl<B: Backend> Metric for LossMetric<B> {
    type Input = LossInput<B>;

    fn update(&mut self, loss: &Self::Input, _metadata: &MetricMetadata) -> MetricEntry {
        let loss = loss.tensor.clone().mean().into_scalar().elem::<f64>();

        self.state
            .update(loss, 1, FormatOptions::new("Loss").precision(2))
    }

    fn clear(&mut self) {
        self.state.reset()
    }
}
```

When the metric you are implementing is numeric in nature, you may want to also implement the
`Numeric` trait. This will allow your metric to be plotted.

```rust, ignore
impl<B: Backend> Numeric for LossMetric<B> {
    fn value(&self) -> f64 {
        self.state.value()
    }
}
```
